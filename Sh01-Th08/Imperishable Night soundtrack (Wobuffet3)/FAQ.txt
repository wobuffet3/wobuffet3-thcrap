Q: Why are songs out of order! Explain.
A: Mostly due to stage and song length.
-Stage 5 is very short, so I used the shortest stage theme. Stage 4 being longer and the original song being a bit mysterious is a perfect reason to use Cinderella Cage, in my opinion, so swapping the two just made sense. 
-Sh01 has one stage 4 boss and two extra stage bosses, and Th08 has vice versa. Both dual bosses are Reimu and Marisa, so it makes sense to swap those songs as well. Aaaaand, I swapped Reisen and Mokou because Mokou's sounds better as a penultimate boss.
-Th08 having two final bosses and a last word is partially why I chose this game's soundtrack to use to begin with. So I just put those three songs over Vivit's themes. I put Voyage 1970 in the middle because both songs are short, and Kaguya's theme sounds more "final" than Eirin's. You fight Eirin first, after all. Unfortunately, I had to leave Eastern Youkai Beauty out, I'm really not sure where I could have put it.
In any case, thank you for downloading! I hope all three of you Seihou fans enjoy it.
